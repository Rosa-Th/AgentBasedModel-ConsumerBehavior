# Agent-Based Model:Consumer Behavior

Based on theoretical and empirical considerations, ORVin is developed to understand consumer purchasing behavior regarding organic wines. To gain insight into the process of wine consumption, the theory of planned behavior is considered along with alphabet theory and goal framing theory. This provides a solid theoretical framework for identifying behavioral factors including beliefs, attitudes, norms, habits, and goals that may influence organic wine purchases. The model can be used to examine the effectiveness of different interventions for encouraging households to purchase organic wine instead of conventional wine. ORVin provides a dynamic platform to study the individual reaction of the disaggregated, low-level actors of the system to the hypothetical changes in the wine market such as taxation, marketing campaigns, and promotions. The cumulative impacts of changing behavior are also evaluated with respect to the environment. This model improves users understanding of the complexity of wine purchasing decisions and help them to further interpret and forecast organic wine market.
